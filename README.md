## Dependencies

### Pybluez

To install pybluez, in theory all you need is python (3.7+) and `pip3 install pybluez`. On windows, I had issues doing this, and relied on [this answer](https://github.com/pybluez/pybluez/issues/180#issuecomment-515016122) to install it.

### Kotlin parser combinator/JSON-kt

See the [json-kt repository](https://github.com/exerro/json-kt).
